                This website is a "quick" passion project for <a href="{{urlref humans.kurt.website}}"
                    title="{{humans.kurt.name}}">me ({{humans.kurt.additionalName}})</a>. It was born out of a desire to
                keep enjoying the game even though i was nearing the end of <a
                    href="{{urlref 'https://www.cassettebeasts.com'}}" title="Cassette Beasts website"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">{{lookup @root.translate 'MAIN_CREDITS_TITLE'}}</a>,
                almost completing all the missions
                and the bestiary.

                I have a range of apps that I make available under the <a href="{{urlref assistantApps.website}}"
                    title="{{assistantApps.name}}">{{assistantApps.name}}</a> name. This small website will be
                considered as one of the apps, although I suspect it will always be smaller than the other games. But I
                am happy for that assumption to be proven wrong! ðŸ˜‚

                <span class="hidden-in-mobile">On the right hand side</span><span class="hidden-in-desktop">Below</span>
                are the members of <a href="{{urlref assistantApps.website}}"
                    title="{{assistantApps.name}}">{{assistantApps.name}}</a>. Their roles are different per app, but I
                could not have gotten to where I am without them ðŸ’–.
